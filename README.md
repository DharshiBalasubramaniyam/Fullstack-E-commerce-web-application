# Project Description

## Features

- This is an e-commerce web application, a platform dedicated to health and wellness products using <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/getting-started-with-microservices-4266f440086f">Microservice architecture pattern</a>.
  
- Secure authentication and authorization functionalities using Spring Security and JWT. Integrated email verification during sign-up.
  
- Comprehensive product and category data management, including adding, editing, viewing, and searching.
  
- Intuitive interface allowing users to easily search and browse products, manage shopping carts, update quantities, and proceed through checkout.
  
- Enabled users to view order history and status, coupled with automated order confirmation emails.
  
- Offered users to pay upon delivery.

## Service Registry

The <a href="./microservice-backend/service-registry">Service Registry</a> serves as a centralized repository for storing information about all the available services in the microservices architecture. 

This includes details such as IP addresses, port numbers, and other metadata required for communication.

As services start, stop, or scale up/down dynamically in response to changing demand, they update their registration information in the Service Registry accordingly.

## API Gateway


The <a href="./microservice-backend/api-gateway">API gateway</a> acts as a centralized entry point for clients, providing a unified interface to access the microservices.

API gateway acts as the traffic cop of our microservices architecture. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice, or instance based on predefined rules or configurations.

# How to run?

## üìçStep 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Fullstack-E-commerce-web-application
```

## üìçStep 2: Setting up databases.

Create the following databases in MongoDB:

- `purely_auth_service`
- `purely_category_service`
- `purely_product_service`
- `purely_cart_service`
- `purely_order_service`

You can find sample data for products and categories to get started [here](./sample%20data/).

## üìçStep 3: Setting up e-mail configurations

In the `notification-service`, configure the following credentials in the [`application.properties`](./microservice-backend/notification-service/src/main/resources/application.properties) file to enable email sending functionality:

```properties
spring.mail.username=YOUR_USERNAME
spring.mail.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual email service credentials.

## üìçStep 4: Run the microservices.

1. First run [`service-registry`](./microservice-backend/service-registry/). Access the Eureka dashboard at [`http://localhost:8761`](http://localhost:8761).

2. Run the other services. Make sure all the services are up and running in the [Eureka Dashboard](http://localhost:8761).
