## üìç Description

- Developed an e-commerce web application, a platform dedicated to health and wellness products using <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/getting-started-with-microservices-4266f440086f">Microservice architecture pattern</a>.
  
- Implemented secure authentication and authorization functionalities using Spring Security and JWT. Integrated email verification during sign-up.
  
- Designed an intuitive interface allowing users to easily search and browse products, manage shopping carts, update quantities, and proceed through checkout.
  
- Enabled users to view order history and status, coupled with automated order confirmation emails.
  
- Offered users to pay upon delivery.
  
- Implemented backend admin functionalities for operations on users, categories, products and orders. Front end admin work is currently in progress.

- Backend is decomposed into several small microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications.

### üöÄ Service Registry

The Service Registry serves as a centralized repository for storing information about all the available services in the microservices architecture. 

This includes details such as IP addresses, port numbers, and other metadata required for communication.

As services start, stop, or scale up/down dynamically in response to changing demand, they update their registration information in the Service Registry accordingly.

### üöÄ API Gateway


The <a href="./microservice-backend/api-gateway">API gateway</a> acts as a centralized entry point for clients, providing a unified interface to access the microservices.

API gateway acts as the traffic cop of our microservices architecture. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice, or instance based on predefined rules or configurations.
